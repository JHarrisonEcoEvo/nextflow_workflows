# nextflow_gbs
Nextflow workflows for RADseq bioinformatics. 

se_demux_to_bam_bai_denovo - Takes single-end Illumina reads, makes a de novo reference, and aligns samples to those reads. Bam and bai files are output.

gbs_nextflow - In progress. This will be an all encompassing RADseq workflow. Currently determining if this makes sense versus using several smaller workflows.
